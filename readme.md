# E-commerce Customer Churn Prediction

This project aims to predict customer churn for an e-commerce business using machine learning techniques. It includes data preparation, exploratory data analysis, model development, and an interactive dashboard for visualizing results.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the raw dataset and preprocessed data
  - `online_retail_II.xlsx`: Raw dataset (not included in repository)
  - `ecommerce_data.csv`: Preprocessed data (generated by data_preparation.py)
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for analysis and model development
  - `ecommerce-churn-prediction-notebook.ipynb`: Main analysis notebook
- `src/`: Python scripts for data preparation and dashboard
  - `data_preparation.py`: Script to preprocess the raw data
  - `dashboard.py`: Dash app for the interactive dashboard
- `models/`: Saved machine learning models
  - `rf_model.joblib`: Random Forest model
  - `xgb_model.joblib`: XGBoost model
  - `nn_model.h5`: Neural Network model
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages
- `README.md`: This file

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Download the "Online Retail II" dataset from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Retail+II) and place `online_retail_II.xlsx` in the `data/` directory
4. Run data preparation script: `python src/data_preparation.py`
5. Open and run the Jupyter notebook: `jupyter notebook notebooks/churn_prediction_analysis.ipynb`
6. Launch the dashboard: `python src/dashboard.py`

## Features

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Machine learning models: Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Network
- Customer segmentation using K-means clustering
- Interactive dashboard for visualizing churn predictions and customer segments

## Results

(Briefly describe your key findings and model performance)

## Future Work

- Implement more advanced feature engineering techniques
